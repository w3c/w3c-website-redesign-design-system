## Font

Apollo uses the [Font Face Observer](https://fontfaceobserver.com/) web font loader to optimise font loading and prevent a flash of invisible text (FOIT).

The default font stack is limited to a choice of system fonts similar to the desired web font. Font Face Observer detects when the `@font-face` files are loaded and adds the `.fonts-loaded` class to the `html` root element, at which point the CSS swaps out the default fonts for the web font.

The web font chosen for this design system is [Noto Sans from Google](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).

## Headings

Use the appropriate semantic `<h#>` to mark up headings. Check that headings are ordered hierarchically, without missing any numbers: `<h2>` is the next level down from `<h1>`, `<h3>` is the next level down from `<h2>`, etc.

All headings start off with a font size of `1.25rem`, slightly larger than the default body text. Further styles are introduced through a suite of [font override classes](#font-override-classes). These classes are tied to [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin) that set combinations of font size and line-height (and sometimes font weight and color), which have been designed to work together.

This approach reinforces the use of the correct semantic elements and provides the freedom to apply whatever visual styling is desired.

The following example shows the recommended classes to use for `<h1>` - `<h6>`. Note that the classes `.txt-mercury`, `.txt-venus` and `.txt-earth` resize at different screen sizes.

{{ macroExample.showCase('Heading styles', '../demos/headings.html') }}

```html
{{ headingMacros.txtMercury('txt-mercury') }}
{{ headingMacros.txtVenus('txt-venus') }}
{{ headingMacros.txtEarth('txt-earth') }}
{{ headingMacros.txtMars('txt-mars') }}
{{ headingMacros.txtJupiter('txt-jupiter') }}
{{ headingMacros.txtSaturn('txt-saturn') }}
```

## Paragraphs

The default paragraph font size is `1rem`, equivalent to 16px browser default.

## Font override classes

There are 9 classes with pre-defined font style treatments in the design system. Some of these are utilized in the [headings](#headings) section above, but here is a complete list with examples. Note that the classes `.txt-mercury`, `.txt-venus` and `.txt-earth` resize at different screen sizes.

{{ macroExample.showCase('Font override classes', '../demos/fonts.html') }}

```html
{{ fontMacros.txtMercury('txt-mercury') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtVenus('txt-venus') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtEarth('txt-earth') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtMars('txt-mars') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtJupiter('txt-jupiter') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtSaturn('txt-saturn') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtPluto('txt-pluto') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtBodyAlt('txt-body-alt') }}
{{ fontMacros.txtEris('txt-eris') }}
```

## Links

Links are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the very end of a sentence, make sure that the full stop is not included within the linked text.

The underline is generated via the `::after` pseudo-element, for internationalization concerns. The default `text-decoration: underline` style does not work well with certain non-Latin characters. Browser support for the `::after` pseudo-element is better than for `text-decoration-skip-ink`, which is not supported at all in Safari at time of writing.

{{ macroExample.showCase('Links', '../demos/links.html') }}

```html
{{ linkMacros.linkDefault('Text link') }}
```

### Opening links in a new tab

Avoid opening links in a new tab or window. It can be disorienting, and can cause [cause accessibility problems for people unable to visually perceive that the new tab has opened](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html).

If there is a definite need for a link to open in a new tab, include the words 'opens in new tab' within the link text. Also, include `rel="noreferrer noopener"` along with `target="_blank"` to reduce the risk of [reverse tabnapping](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing).

```html
{{ linkMacros.linkTab('Text link (opens in new tab)') }}
```

## Lists

Use lists to make blocks of text easier to read, and to break information into manageable chunks.

### Bulleted lists

Unordered lists without any classes are styled with bullets.

{{ macroExample.showCase('Default unordered list', '../demos/list-unordered.html') }}

```html
{{ listBullet.listUnordered() }}
```

### Numbered lists

Use numbered lists when the order of the items is important.

{{ macroExample.showCase('Default ordered list', '../demos/list-ordered.html') }}

```html
{{ listNumber.listOrdered() }}
```
